										<h2>CORRUPTION IS LEECH TO INDIA</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The problem in our country is not the lack of knowledge or understanding about corrupt practices but the lack of courage to stand against such practices. It is very easy to target others including politicians but what about common man?
									</p>
									<P>We have to understand that the system is corrupt because we are also corrupt. First, we have to change ourselves then only we can expect change in others. This is a very old method to point the fingers towards the wrongdoing of others. But no one is ready to check their own character
									</P>
									<p> No, that is the truth. We are no more different from those whom we are abusing continuously on different forum including media. We are ready to talk about corruption till the time we want to abuse politics. For me doing anything wrong is also a type of corruption and most of us in some way or other are involved in corrupt practices. It is quite possible that most readers will not agree with me on this because they are also in the same boat.
									</p>
									<p>Let us see whatever what I am saying is correct or not. We are ready to pay money in the form of bribe to get connections of different types such as gas, water, and electricity - all out of turn. There may be others in the society who are not able to pay such bribes to get such connections out of turn and even some time they have to wait for longer period of time just because of people like us so called middle class who want corruption to be eradicated from society.
									</p>
									<p>There are others in the middle class - especially small time businessmen like shopkeepers of different types, - and they may be earning more than what we are getting in the form of our monthly salary but they are not ready to pay income tax. There will be more than 10 million such shops in our country and most of them are not paying enough taxes as per law. 
									</p>
									<p>There is no development in six years in this elephant village. It is our government who is supposed to charge 50 rupees from the people who visit there , surely for the devlopment of the village but nothing has changed from past six years. Approximately, from the research Rs. 2.3 crores has been collected in the elephant welfare fund . 
									</p>
									<p>People opposing FDI in retail sector are actually supporting such shopkeepers. What is the need in the world for the parties to fight on such important issue of FDI because of such tax evaders? They know very well how to evade income tax and other taxes - and they are at the same time running a market of black money. Whereas FDI will bring a lot of money to the government in the form different taxes but it will ensure transparency too in the retail segment. 
									</p>
									<p>  <span style="color: red;"> <strong>So basic question remains - are we really interested to eradicate corruption from our society? </strong> </span> If the answer is yes, then we have to start from ourselves rather than ask others to do. First, we have to change and then only we can expect the change in others. You should prove that you are right then only you can ask others to follow the suit. Let us assume one person in each family take a vow to be not corrupt whatever circumstances will be there believe me that more than 50% corruption will eradicate at very such time.
									</p>
									<p>Do we have courage to take such a vow? I don’t think so. If yes, for which chances are very less, then it will be really good for the country as a whole.
