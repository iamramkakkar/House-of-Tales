										<h2>PITCH  STYLEFRAMES ON TECHNOlOGY</h2>
									</header>
									<p>CES is a story of innovation , it is the tech industry’s annual trade show. This year CES was a gathering of professionals from almost every industry. They provides a fascinating look into our high-tech future.</p>
									<p>The show’s doors were opened on Tuesday , in Las Vegas .The technologies that connect everything from small refrigerators and high tech cars to your digital world. For years, CES has “largely been a device show”, but not this year. Software serving as connective tissue for those gadgets will steal the show. </p>
									<p>Voice is seen as some second or tenth coming of marketing. It's on countless CES trend lists this year, just like it was the year before. Amazon has joined the handful of companies that need no presence at the conference to dominate the conversation. This year, one electronics brand after another had announced a voice-activated device, typically powered by Amazon, Google, or Microsoft . A handful of branded voice apps are very good and could prove valuable to marketers. Yet for every person interacting with a brand's app, expect 10,000 other people to chat with Amazon to buy the cheapest well-rated item in any category, and that's not usually going to be a product from a brand with an eight- or nine-figure ad budget.</p>
									<p>
									5G is the new LTE
                                    5G will make your LTE feel like a 1200 baud modem. Yes, superfast mobile broadband is coming. Smartphone users will love it, once they upgrade to the currently non-existent smartphones since current ones don't yet support 5G. Internet-connected devices (the Internet of Things) and bandwidth-heavy technologies like virtual reality will work better. But it won't matter too much for marketers since the mobile ship set sail long ago, and the main hold-ups for technologies like IoT and VR are the applications for it, not the speed. 
									</p>
									<p>CES remains a valuable experience for thousands of marketers. A large part of the event is what I once called "Shadow CES," where marketers meet with sellers and agencies for 2018 planning, and many of those marketers don't make it to a single CES exhibit. The business opportunities are real, but a lot of the most buzzworthy trends are a reflection of the pundits and not the event. Even if you don't attend the event, just tell people that you're so excited for how 5G will pave the way for blockchain-powered voice apps. That makes at least as much sense as anything you'll read about the show. Creativity is at the root of all innovation.As innovations accelerate and our world becomes more connected, creativity and the way it fuels growth in our business organizations is evolving. It's not an isolated skill for one industry or section of the business. We all need it if we're going to thrive in the future.
                                    The awards program recently announced some major changes to its marquee event, the International Festival of Creativity</p>
                                    <p> Best of the Best and People's Choice of 2018 were:</p>
                                    <p><strong>Best Accessibility Tech: XENOMA E-SKIN PAJAMAS</strong> Accessibility has become a major theme at CES, and it's one of the harder categories to judge because of all the potentially life-changing tech on the floor. But Xenoma's e-skin pajamas took the prize this year thanks to its innovative fabric sensors that can stand up to the abuse of a washing machine and don't need any sort of liquid or gel to keep conductivity with your skin. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>Best Transportation Technology: TOYOTA E-PALETTE</strong>
                                    The automotive world is flooded with the word mobility. It's become shorthand for ride-hailing and car sharing. Toyota saw mobility and decided that in addition to getting people around, it's important to transport their goods and their small business. The e-Palette is a vehicle that resembles a train car, but more than that, it's an opportunity for businesses big and small to take retail and delivery to the next level. It can be a taxi, food truck, flower mart, delivery truck, office or even a place to sleep. It's a blank slate on wheels, and in this quickly changing world, that might be exactly what we need.
</p>                                <p><strong>Best Phone or Mobile Device: LENOVO MIIX 630</strong> 
                                    This Windows 10 2-in-1 may seem like an odd choice, but it fits the bill because of what's inside it: a Snapdragon 835 chipset, just like the one in your phone. As a result, the Lenovo Miix 630 is incredibly fast to wake up, and its battery can withstand as many as 20 hours of use on a single charge. Throw in an excellent keyboard and the ability to add a SIM card inside for on-the-go data and we just might have the perfect machine for road warriors</p>

                                <p><strong>Best Gaming Product: HTC VIVEPRO</strong>
                                HTC is already a leader of the PC VR world with the Vive, and its latest headset upgrades the original model in a few crucial ways. The HTC Vive Pro adds integrated 3D audio, a more comfortable head strap, dual front-facing cameras, two mics and beefed-up resolution -- 2,880 x 1,600 combined and 615 pixels per inch. The Vive Pro is a slight but welcome update that keeps the VR industry moving in the right direction.</p>

                                <p><strong>Best Robot or Drone: SONY AIBO</strong>
                                Sony's adorable robot dog is back. This time, AIBO is more intelligent, connected and agile. As well as being a pettable companion, it has an onboard camera allows it to act as an adorably mobile webcam. Its OLED eyes are extremely expressive, and its WiFi and LTE connectivity allow it to function on the move. It's a true return to form for perhaps the most popular consumer robot ever.
                                <br>
                                One of the most hotly rumored new smartphone features of the past few months, we've now finally seen an in-display finterprint scanner in action at CES 2018. And no, it's not from a Samsung or Apple handset, but rather a phone by Chinese firm Vivo. 
                                To be clear, this is the world's first smartphone with an in-display fingerprint scanner.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>The best laptops of CES 2018</strong>
                                Laptop makers had a huge presence at this year's CES, with all the big names such as Asus, HP and Lenovo showing off their latest devices. To be honest, we were spoilt for choice when it came to choosing the best laptops of 2018, but we narrowed it down to bring you our pick of the top notebooks we saw in Las Vegas.</p>
                                <p>
                                	That’s it from the thousands products, we have talked on some of the best CES 2018 products.
